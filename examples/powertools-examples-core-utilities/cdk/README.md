#  Powertools for AWS Lambda (Java) - Core Utilities Example with CDK

This project demonstrates the Lambda for Powertools Java module deployed using [Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).

For general information on the deployed example itself, you can refer to the parent [README](../README.md)

## Configuration
CDK uses the following project structure:
- [app](app) - stores the source code of your application, which is similar between all examples
- [infra](infra) - stores the definition of your infrastructure
  - [cdk.json](infra/cdk.json) - tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app
  - [CdkApp](infra/src/main/java/cdk/CdkApp.java) - bootstraps your stack, taking AWS `account` and `region` as input
  - [CdkStack](infra/src/main/java/cdk/CdkStack.java) - defines the Lambda function to be deployed as well as API Gateway for it.

It is a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) based project, so you can open this project with any Maven compatible Java IDE to build and run tests.


## Deploy the sample application

The minimum to deploy the app should be
```bash 
cdk deploy
```

If you're running CDK for the first time, you'll need to first run the bootstrap command:
```bash
cdk bootstrap
```

## Useful commands

* `mvn package`     compile and run tests
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation
