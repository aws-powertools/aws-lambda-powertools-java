#  Powertools for AWS Lambda (Java) - Core Utilities Example with Serverless Framework

This project demonstrates the Lambda for Powertools Java module deployed using [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/framework).
For general information on the deployed example itself, you can refer to the parent [README](../README.md).
To install Serverless Framework if you don't have it yet, you can follow the [Getting Started Guide](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started).

## Configuration
Serverless Framework uses [serverless.yml](serverless.yml) to define the application's AWS resources.
This file defines the Lambda function to be deployed as well as API Gateway for it.

It is a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) based project, so you can open this project with any Maven compatible Java IDE to build and run tests.

To deploy the app, simply run the following commands:
```bash 
mvn package && sls deploy
```
