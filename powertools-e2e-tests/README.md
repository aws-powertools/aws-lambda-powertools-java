## End-to-end tests
This module is internal and meant to be used for end-to-end (E2E) testing of Lambda Powertools for Java. 

__Prerequisites__: 
- An AWS account is needed as well as a local environment able to reach this account 
([credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html)).
- [Java 11+](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

To execute the E2E tests, use the following command: `export JAVA_VERSION=11 && mvn clean verify -Pe2e`

### Under the hood
This module leverages the following components:
- AWS CDK to define the infrastructure and synthesize a CloudFormation template and the assets (lambda function packages)
- The AWS S3 SDK to push the assets on S3
- The AWS CloudFormation SDK to deploy the template
