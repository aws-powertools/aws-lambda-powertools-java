title: SQS Large Message Handling
description: Utility
---

The large message handling utility handles SQS messages which have had their payloads
offloaded to S3 due to them being larger than the SQS maximum.

The utility automatically retrieves messages which have been offloaded to S3 using the
[amazon-sqs-java-extended-client-lib](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sqs-java-extended-client-lib)
client library. Once the message payloads have been processed successful the
utility can delete the message payloads from S3.

This utility is compatible with versions *1.1.0+* of amazon-sqs-java-extended-client-lib.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>
    <artifactId>amazon-sqs-java-extended-client-lib</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Install

To install this utility, add the following dependency to your project.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>software.amazon.lambda</groupId>
    <artifactId>powertools-sqs</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0-beta</version>
</dependency>
```

And configure the aspectj-maven-plugin to compile-time weave (CTW) the
aws-lambda-powertools-java aspects into your project. You may already have this
plugin in your pom. In that case add the depenedency to the `aspectLibraries`
section.

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        ...
        <plugin>
             <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
             <artifactId>aspectj-maven-plugin</artifactId>
             <version>1.11</version>
             <configuration>
                 <source>1.8</source>
                 <target>1.8</target>
                 <complianceLevel>1.8</complianceLevel>
                 <aspectLibraries>
                     ...
                     <aspectLibrary>
                         <groupId>software.amazon.lambda</groupId>
                         <artifactId>powertools-sqs</artifactId>
                     </aspectLibrary>
                     ...
                 </aspectLibraries>
             </configuration>
             <executions>
                 <execution>
                     <goals>
                         <goal>compile</goal>
                     </goals>
                 </execution>
             </executions>
        </plugin>
        ...
    </plugins>
</build>
```

The annotation `@LargeMessageHandler` should be used with the handleRequest method of a class
which implements `com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.RequestHandler` with
`com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.events.SQSEvent` as the first parameter.

```java
public class SqsMessageHandler implements RequestHandler<SQSEvent, String> {

    @Override
    @LargeMessageHandler
    public String handleRequest(SQSEvent sqsEvent, Context context) {
    // process messages

    return "ok";
    }
}
```

`@LargeMessageHandler` creates a default S3 Client `AmazonS3 amazonS3 = AmazonS3ClientBuilder.defaultClient()`.
When the Lambda function is invoked with an event from SQS, each record received
in the SQSEvent will be checked to see if it's body contains a payload which has
been offloaded to S3. If it does then `getObject(bucket, key)` will be called,
and the payload retrieved. If there is an error during this process then the
function will fail with a `FailedProcessingLargePayloadException` exception.

If the request handler method returns without error then each payload will be
deleted from S3 using `deleteObject(bucket, key)`

To disable deletion of payloads setting the following annotation parameter:

```java
@LargeMessageHandler(deletePayloads=false)
public class SqsMessageHandler implements RequestHandler<SQSEvent, String> {
}
```
