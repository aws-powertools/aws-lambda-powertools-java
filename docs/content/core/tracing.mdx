Powertools tracing is an opinionated thin wrapper for [AWS X-Ray Java SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-java/)
a provides functionality to reduce the overhead of performing common tracing tasks.

 ** Key Features

 * Capture cold start as annotation, and responses as well as full exceptions as metadata
 * Helper methods to improve the developer experience of creating new X-Ray subsegments.
 * Better developer experience when developing with multiple threads.

Initialization
Your AWS Lambda function must have permission to send traces to AWS X-Ray - Here is an example using AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)

```yaml:title=template.yaml
Resources:
    HelloWorldFunction:
        Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
        Properties:
        ...
        Runtime: java8

        Tracing: Active
        Environment:
            Variables:
                POWERTOOLS_SERVICE_NAME: example
```

The Powertools service name is used as the X-Ray namespace. This can be set using the environment variable
`POWERTOOLS_SERVICE_NAME`

To enable Powertools tracing to your function add the @PowertoolsTracing annotation to your handleRequest method.

```java
public class App implements RequestHandler<APIGatewayProxyRequestEvent, APIGatewayProxyResponseEvent> {

    @PowertoolsTracing
    public APIGatewayProxyResponseEvent handleRequest(APIGatewayProxyRequestEvent input, Context context) {
    ...
    }
```

By default this annotation will automatically record method responses and exceptions. To disable these features set the
parameter to false in the annotation.

```java
public class App implements RequestHandler<APIGatewayProxyRequestEvent, APIGatewayProxyResponseEvent> {

    @PowertoolsTracing(captureError = false, captureResponse = false)
    public APIGatewayProxyResponseEvent handleRequest(APIGatewayProxyRequestEvent input, Context context) {
    ...
    }
```
