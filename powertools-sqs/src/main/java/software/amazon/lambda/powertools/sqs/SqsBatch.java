/**
 * {@link SqsBatch} is used to process batch messages in {@link SQSEvent}
 *
 * <p>
 * When using the annotation, implementation of {@link SqsMessageHandler} is required. Annotation will take care of
 * calling {@link SqsMessageHandler#process(SQSMessage)} method for each {@link SQSMessage} in the received {@link SQSEvent}
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If any exception is thrown from {@link SqsMessageHandler#process(SQSMessage)} during processing of a messages, Utility
 * will take care of deleting all the successful messages from SQS. When one or more single message fails processing due
 * to exception thrown from {@link SqsMessageHandler#process(SQSMessage)}, Lambda execution will fail
 * with {@link SQSBatchProcessingException}.
 * <p>
 * If all the messages are successfully processes, No SQS messages are deleted explicitly but is rather delegated to
 * Lambda execution context for deletion.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you want to suppress the exception even if any message in batch fails, set
 * {@link SqsBatch#suppressException()} to true. By default its value is false
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you want certain exceptions to be treated as permanent failures, i.e. exceptions where the result of retrying will
 * always be a failure and want these can be immediately moved to the dead letter queue associated to the source SQS queue,
 * <p>
 * you can use {@link SqsBatch#nonRetryableExceptions()} to configure such exceptions.
 * Make sure function execution role has sqs:GetQueueAttributes permission on source SQS queue and sqs:SendMessage,
 * sqs:SendMessageBatch permission for configured DLQ.
 * <p>
 * If you want such messages to be deleted instead, set {@link SqsBatch#deleteNonRetryableMessageFromQueue()} to true.
 * By default its value is false.
 * <p>
 * If there is no DLQ configured on source SQS queue and {@link SqsBatch#nonRetryableExceptions()} attribute is set, if
 * nonRetryableExceptions occurs from {@link SqsMessageHandler}, such exceptions will still be treated as temporary
 * exceptions and the message will be moved back to source SQS queue for reprocessing. The same behaviour will occur if
 * for some reason the utility is unable to move the message to the DLQ. An example of this could be because the function
 * is missing the correct permissions.
